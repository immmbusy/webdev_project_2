      <h1>Blender</h1>
      <p>The following are my newer projects</p>
      <p>
        Using Blender (3D software for game design or animation production, as seen in some Disney movies like *Elephants Dream* and *Spring*).
      </p>
      
      <h3>Honda Civic Type R 2021</h3>
      <p>
        The most challenging part was making the frame. I had to create a singular vertex and branch it out to create the entire outside frame, windows, and car doors.

      <h3>Donut and Tray</h3>
      <p>
        My first project in Blender was the donut. The hardest part was making the glaze drip down the donut. I wasnâ€™t able to achieve it as I had hoped, but I hope you still find my donut delicious!
